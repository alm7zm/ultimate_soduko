Heads up! This web app is still a work in progress. We're still hitting some requirements and updating the docs as we go.
Also, there is no database yet—everything is handled client-side, so your progress is tied to your current browser session.
# Software Requirements Specification
## Web-Based Sudoku Application

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the software requirements for a highly engaging web-based Sudoku application. It outlines the core gameplay mechanics (similar to sudoku.com) and the extended retention-focused features designed to create daily active habits among users.

### 1.2 Scope

The product will be a responsive web application playable on desktop and mobile browsers. It will provide classic Sudoku puzzles alongside modern gaming elements such as progression systems, daily quests, competitive multiplayer (PvP), and cosmetic rewards to drive long-term user retention.

---

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

The application will operate as a standalone web app. It will utilize a client-server architecture where the frontend handles the grid interactions and animations, while the backend manages user accounts, puzzle generation/validation, leaderboards, and multiplayer matchmaking.

### 2.2 User Classes

| User Class | Description |
|---|---|
| **Casual Solvers** | Play occasionally to pass the time; rely on hints and easy modes. |
| **Daily Habit Builders** | Motivated by streaks, daily challenges, and light progression. |
| **Competitive / Hardcore Players** | Seek leaderboards, ranked matchmaking, and complex puzzle variants (Expert/Evil difficulties). |

## 3. Functional Requirements (System Features)

### 3.1 Core Sudoku Engine (The Basics)

- **Grid Generation:** System must generate unique, solvable 9×9 Sudoku grids.
- **Input Mechanics:** Numpad support (desktop), touch-to-select (mobile), and drag-to-fill.
- **Notes (Pencil Marks):** Ability to toggle a "Notes" mode to write multiple potential numbers in a single cell. Automatically clear notes when the correct number is placed in the same row/column/block.
- **Game Assists:**
  - Undo/Redo buttons
  - Eraser tool
  - Hints (reveals a correct cell; limited per game)
  - Highlighting (highlights identical numbers across the board when one is selected)
- **Mistake Tracking:** Option to limit mistakes (e.g., 3 strikes and you lose the game) to add stakes.

### 3.2 Difficulty & Puzzle Variants

- **Standard Difficulties:** Fast, Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert, Evil.
- **Special Rulesets** *(Unlocked via progression):* Killer Sudoku, Diagonal Sudoku, and Thermo Sudoku. Introducing new rules prevents the game from feeling repetitive over months of play.

### 3.3 Retention & Engagement Features (The "Hook")

To keep people returning daily, the system will implement the following mechanics:

#### Daily Quests & Streaks

- Users receive **3 daily quests** (e.g., "Solve 2 Medium puzzles without hints," "Use the notes feature 10 times").
- **Streak Counter:** A prominent fire icon tracks consecutive days played. Missing a day resets it, but users can buy a "Streak Freeze" using in-game earned currency.

#### Experience (XP) & Leveling System

- Every puzzle completed grants XP based on difficulty, speed, and accuracy (no mistakes).
- Leveling up unlocks new profile titles, avatars, and custom board themes.

#### The "Puzzle Journey" (Campaign Mode)

Instead of just clicking "Play," users have a visual map with nodes. Each node is a puzzle with specific win conditions (e.g., "Solve within 5 minutes," "Max 1 mistake"). This creates a sense of continuous progression.

#### Live Multiplayer (PvP Sudoku Battles)

- **Ranked Matchmaking:** Two players are given the exact same board. The first to finish (or the one with the highest score when the timer runs out) wins ranking points (ELO).
- **Co-op Mode:** Two players share a board and work together to solve a massive 16×16 grid.

#### Leagues & Tournaments

Weekly leaderboards divided into Leagues (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond). The top 20% promote to the next league, bottom 20% demote. This triggers competitive psychology.

#### Cosmetic Shop & Virtual Currency

- Players earn **"Sudoku Coins"** by playing.
- Coins can be spent on:
  - Visual themes (Dark mode, Neon, Woodcraft, Cyberpunk)
  - Custom fonts for the numbers
  - Animated background effects

### 3.4 User Accounts & Social

- **Authentication:** Sign up/Login via Email, Google, or Apple. Guest mode allowed (but prompts to save progress will encourage account creation).
- **Cloud Sync:** Start a puzzle on a desktop, seamlessly resume on a mobile phone.
- **Friend System:** Add friends, send them specific board challenges ("Beat my time of 3:42 on this seed!"), and view a friends-only leaderboard.

---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance Requirements

- **Load Time:** The initial grid must load in under 1.5 seconds.
- **Responsiveness:** Grid interactions (clicking, inputting numbers) must have zero perceptible latency (<50ms).
- **Offline Support:** The app should function as a Progressive Web App (PWA). It must cache daily puzzles so users can play on their commute without an internet connection, syncing their score once reconnected.

### 4.2 Usability & UI/UX

- **Mobile-First Design:** Buttons must be large enough for thumb-tapping. The board must scale perfectly to any screen size without horizontal scrolling.
- **Accessibility:** High contrast modes, colorblind-friendly highlighting, and screen-reader support for menus.

### 4.3 Security Requirements

- **Anti-Cheat System:** The server must validate completion times and inputs to prevent automated solver scripts from ruining the multiplayer and leaderboard integrity.
- **Data Protection:** User passwords and data must be encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest.

## 5. Suggested Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | React.js or Vue.js; HTML5 Canvas or SVG for board rendering |
| **Backend** | Node.js with Express or Python with FastAPI |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL (user data, stats, relations) + Redis (real-time matchmaking, leaderboards) |
| **Real-Time Communication** | WebSockets (Socket.io) for live PvP battles and friend notifications |

## 6. Development Roadmap

### Phase 1 — MVP
Build the core grid, puzzle generator, standard difficulties, and basic UI *(the Sudoku.com clone phase)*.

### Phase 2 — Habit Building
Integrate user accounts, XP system, daily streaks, and the cosmetic shop.

### Phase 3 — Community
Launch PvP battles, leagues, and friend challenges.
